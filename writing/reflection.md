#### Questions

Please address the following prompts to demonstrate the feasibility of your research project idea. You are to anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.

0. Describe your work as a thought experiment. For this imagine all pieces of your project coming together to create the deliverable that you have indicated during another assignment in this course. Describe what these pieces look like. How are they used? What specific resources do you require (skills, data, programming, something else?) to make this project successful? What resources can you currently access? Which ones are still not yet accessible? Write down your _thought experiment_ where you imagine yourself reaching the goals of the project.

TODO

Below you are to expend on the following common components of projects. 

1. __Hardware__: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

TODO

2. __Tools__: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

TODO

3. __Skills__: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

TODO

4. __Data__: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

TODO

5. __Time__: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

TODO

6. __Results__: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

TODO

7. __Analysis__: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

TODO

8. __Other abilities and resources__: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

TODO

9. __Threats to Validity__: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

TODO

10. Please provide a cohesive blog post for feasibility on your website (min 200 words) to summarize your answers for the above questions.

TODO (Please remove this tag once this task has been completed.)
